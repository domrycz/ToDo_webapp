# ToDo_webapp

Very simple web application

I decided to make my own "to do" app - I know that making it in Java isn't the best way but... who cares :)

It's a simple project which I have been developing for fun in my spare time when I want to take a break from studying more advanced things.
I wanted to make something simple and using JDBC instead of JPA.

## Assumptions
- Java EE
- without frameworks (without JPA, CDI, Spring etc.)
- connection with MySQL by JDBC
- Tomcat
