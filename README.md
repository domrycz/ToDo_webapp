# ToDo_webapp

Very simple web application

I decided to make my own "to do" app - I know that making it in Java isn't the best way but... who cares :)

It's a simple project which I develop in my spare time when I want to take a break from studying more advanced things.

# Assumptions
- Java EE without any frameworks
- IntelliJ IDEA and Tomcat 8
